##### What is the problem, and computational propblem?

A problem is an issue and needs an answer.

A computational problem is a problem needs an answer but after doing some operations. Like 5 + 8 = ?

##### What is the algorithm?

The algorithm is a solution for a computational problem. But to call it an algorithm, it should contains some conditions. 

1. The algorithm should be a group of setps.
2. The steps should be terminated, means after finishing the steps will lead to the solution.
3. Not ambiguite. Ex: instead of say go right, should say go right for 1 step. or go right for 2 steps.
