# Programing

## Programming level 0

##### What computers do?
```
- input         Read  (RAM)
- processing    + - / * ...  (Modification, Extract new data)
- output        Write
```

##### What is the problem, and computational propblem?
```
A problem is an issue and needs an answer.

A computational problem is a problem needs an answer but after doing some operations. Like 5 + 8 = ?
```
##### What is the algorithm?
```
The algorithm is a solution for a computational problem. But to call it an algorithm, it should contains some conditions. 

1. The algorithm should be a group of setps.
2. The steps should be terminated, means after finishing the steps will lead to the solution.
3. Not ambiguite. Ex: instead of say go right, should say go right for 1 step. or go right for 2 steps.

> output devices types

> Computational problem ➡️ algorithm ➡️ code by any language

##### What is the variable?
```
The variable is a location in memory to store data.
