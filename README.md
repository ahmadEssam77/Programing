# Programing

## Programming level 0

##### What computers do?
```
- input         Read  (RAM)
- processing    + - / * ...  (Modification, Extract new data)
- output        Write
```

##### What is the problem, and computational propblem?
```
A problem is an issue and needs an answer.

A computational problem is a problem needs an answer but after doing some operations. Like 5 + 8 = ?
```
##### What is the algorithm?
```
The algorithm is a solution for a computational problem. But to call it an algorithm, it should contains some conditions. 

1. The algorithm should be a group of setps.
2. The steps should be terminated, means after finishing the steps will lead to the solution.
3. Not ambiguite. Ex: instead of say go right, should say go right for 1 step. or go right for 2 steps.

> Computer = Micoprocessor + RAM
> input devices types
> output devices types

> Computational problem ➡️ algorithm ➡️ code by any language

##### What is the variable?
```
The variable is a location in memory to store data.
```

##### Algorithm types
```
- Pseudo code
- Flowchart
```

##### Statement vs Expression
```
z = 5 + 7; is a statement
5 + 7; only is an expression
```

> Algorithm + Data structure = Programing.

##### Statements types
```
- Expressions statements  5 + 7;
- Selection statements     if
- Iteration statements     for
- Declaration statements
- Boolean expressions      true || false
- Function statement       wrapping or blocking some statements
- Function calling         read();
```

##### For vs While loop
```
for => You know the iteration number.
while => when you don't know the iteration number.
```

##### Two types of functions
```
1. built-in functions      (you know them by learning and checking the docs)
2. user defined function   (your function)
```
